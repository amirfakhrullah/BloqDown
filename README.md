# Polley

Simple Forum site using `Next.js`, `TypeScript`, `Prisma`, `PlanetScale` and `tRPC`. The aim here is to learn how to properly use these techstacks.

## Goals For This Project

I know the UI for this project is pretty trash. But that's not the goal for building this site. The goals for this project are:

- Creating fully typesafe APIs using `trpc`
- Using `Prisma` as `TypeScript ORM`
- Setting up `PlanetScale` as `MySQL` db for the site

## Getting Started

### Installations

```bash
npm install
